docs: Add comprehensive LED effects documentation and inline comments

This commit addresses LED effects configuration and memory management
considerations in the TX Ultimate Easy firmware.

Changes:
1. ESPHome/TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome_core_hw_leds.yaml
   - Added detailed inline documentation about LED effects
   - Explained memory constraints and optimization strategies
   - Documented the difference between effects-enabled and no-effects partitions
   - Referenced future ESPHome 2025.11.0-DEV memory optimizations

2. docs/LED_EFFECTS.md (NEW)
   - Comprehensive guide to LED effects configuration
   - Detailed table of all 10 available effect types
   - Memory considerations and optimization strategies
   - Future roadmap for effect re-enablement
   - Developer notes with examples
   - Testing checklist for modifications
   - Implementation details and file references

3. README.md
   - Added "Documentation" section after Key Features
   - Links to LED Effects guide and Event System documentation
   - Clear explanation of current limitations and plans

Context:
LED effects were previously subject to memory constraints on ESP32 devices.
Current implementation provides full effects on main light groups (light_eu/light_us)
while individual LED segments have effects disabled to conserve memory.

Future ESPHome releases (2025.11.0-DEV+) are expected to bring memory
optimizations that may allow re-enabling effects on more partitions.
