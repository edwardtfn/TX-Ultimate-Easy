## Framework Migration to ESP-IDF

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **ESP-IDF Framework Migration**
> 
> Starting with version **2025.8.0**, TX Ultimate Easy will use **ESP-IDF** as the default framework, following ESPHome's direction towards ESP-IDF for better performance, stability, and feature support.
> 
> **What this means for you:**
> - **New installations**: Will automatically use ESP-IDF (no action required)
> - **Existing Arduino users**: Can continue using Arduino but with limited support
> - **Migration recommended**: For better performance and full feature support
> 
> **Arduino Framework Support:**
> - Still functional but **no longer actively tested**
> - **Limited support** will be provided for Arduino-specific issues
> - May miss out on new features optimized for ESP-IDF

### Migration Guidelines

#### For New Users
No action required - ESP-IDF will be used automatically.

#### For Existing Arduino Users

**Option 1: Migrate to ESP-IDF (Recommended)**
1. **Best practice**: Flash via serial/USB to ensure proper partition setup
2. **Alternative**: If serial flashing isn't possible, flash OTA twice consecutively to improve success rate

**Option 2: Continue with Arduino**
Add this to your YAML configuration to force Arduino framework:
```yaml
esp32:
  framework:
    type: arduino
```

> [!WARNING]  
> **Migration via OTA:** When switching frameworks via OTA, the partition table may not update correctly. Flash twice in succession to ensure both firmware partitions contain the latest firmware and prevent boot failures.

## Integration with Home Assistant

TX Ultimate Easy exposes your device's components (sensors, touch panel, relays, etc.) to Home Assistant,
allowing you to:

- Monitor sensor states and values
- Control device components through the Home Assistant UI
- Use device triggers and states in your Home Assistant automations and scripts
- Configure device behavior through Home Assistant's service calls

All automation capabilities are handled through Home Assistant's
native automation system - this project focuses on providing reliable
device integration rather than implementing its own automation tools.

### Event-Based Automation

TX Ultimate Easy uses Home Assistant's native Events system for reliable automation triggers.
While sensors show the current state (e.g., button pressed/not pressed),
events capture-specific actions like clicks, swipes, and long presses.

For more details, please refer to our **[Events docs](docs/events.md)**.

### Device Configuration
#### Relay Modes
- **Light Mode**: Exposes the relay as a light entity with brightness controls (if supported)
- **Switch Mode**: Exposes the relay as a simple on/off switch entity

#### Button Actions
- **None**: Allows using button events for custom automations
  Example: Trigger scenes or complex automations through Home Assistant
- **Relay Toggle**: Direct control of the associated relay
  Example: Toggle relay state with each press, independent of Home Assistant

#### Automation
All device behaviors can be customized through Home Assistant automations without relying on local device triggers.

## Key Features

- **Home Assistant UI Configuration**: Manage all device settings directly through the Home Assistant interface
- **Zero YAML Knowledge Required**: After initial setup, no manual YAML editing needed
- **Flexible Light Control**: Customize LED behavior and effects
- **Touch Panel Support**: Full support for touch gestures and multi-touch capabilities
- **Advanced Automations**: Create complex automations using Home Assistant's powerful automation engine
- **Bluetooth Proxy Support**: Compatible with ESPHome's bluetooth_proxy component for BLE device integration
- **Audio Feedback**: Built-in speaker support for audible feedback
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration motor support for tactile feedback
- **ESP-IDF Framework**: Enhanced performance and stability with ESP-IDF support

> you must add them manually to your local configuration file.
> For example:
> ```yaml
> # Add these to your configuration if needed
> web_server:
> captive_portal:
> wifi:
>   ap: # Access point configuration
> ```

### Optional Features

#### Bluetooth Proxy
TX Ultimate Easy is fully compatible with ESPHome's `bluetooth_proxy` component.
To enable Bluetooth proxy functionality, add the following to your device configuration:

```yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  # Optional: Configure specific settings
  # active: true
```

**Requirements for Bluetooth Proxy:**
- ESP-IDF framework (default framework, not recommended with Arduino framework)
- Sufficient memory (TX Ultimate Easy components are compatible,
  but adding additional custom components may require memory optimization)

> [!NOTE]
> Bluetooth proxy functionality is provided by ESPHome's native component.
> TX Ultimate Easy ensures compatibility but does not include it by default to maintain optimal memory usage.

### Advanced Settings
For more granular control over components,
you can use our [advanced configuration template](TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome_advanced.yaml).
This template allows you to selectively include specific packages, which can be useful for:

- Troubleshooting specific components
- Reducing memory usage by excluding unused features
- Customizing functionality for specific use cases

Here's an example of the advanced configuration:
```yaml
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/TX-Ultimate-Easy
    ref: main  # Or you can specify a version, like `ref: v2024.12.6` or `ref: latest`
    refresh: 5min
    files:
      # Core (essential) packages
      - ESPHome/TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome_core_common.yaml            # Basic shared settings
      - ESPHome/TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome_core_hw_buttons.yaml        # Button logic
      - ESPHome/TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome_core_hw_leds.yaml           # LED configuration
